//Messi is a soccer player with goals in three leagues:
//LaLiga

//In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?
//Examples
//makeNegative(1);    // return -1
//makeNegative(-5);   // return -5
//makeNegative(0);    // return 0
//makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12
//Notes
//The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
//Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

//Terminal game move function
//In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the dice and moves the number of spaces indicated by the dice two times.
//Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the hero and the roll (1-6) and return the new position.
//Example:
//move(3, 6) should equal 15

// Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.
// You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink, rounded to the smallest value.

// time = 3 ----> litres = 1
// time = 6.7---> litres = 3
// time = 11.8--> litres = 5

// Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.
